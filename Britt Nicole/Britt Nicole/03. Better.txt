
Hey girl in the back of the classroom afraid to stand out
So scared that you say the wrong thing so you don't make a sound
Paper planes in the sky, crashing one at a time
Praying that they don't learn where you hide

Baby, I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that inside
It'll get better, it'll get better
It'll get better
It's gonna get better

Hey girl in the back of the classroom
Just be strong
Some days feel like forever
But it won't be long
Until your sittin' on top of the world baby believe it
Like a paper plane in the sky, you'll fly, oh

I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time
It'll get better, it's gonna get better

I know your hurting inside
And you just wanna cry
I know your hurting inside, inside yeah
But tell all of the shadows goodbye
Show 'em your bright side
I know, I know yeah... Oh
It's gonna get better, so long

'Cause baby I've been there
I've seen it all before
Baby, I was you
Hoping for something more
Baby, I promise
Cross my heart that in time
It'll get better, it's gonna get better yeah

It'll get better
It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better

Hey girl in the back of the classroom
Just be strong...
