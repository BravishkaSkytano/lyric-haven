
[Verse 1]
There it is
I think we got the perfect shot
You'd never know at dinner we didn't even talk
And we look so amazing
Who wouldn't wanna be us?
But the smile that we're faking
Fades when the camera's off

[Pre-Chorus]
And we hold it
Just for the moment

[Chorus]
And what we let the whole world see
Isn't really you and me
So tell me was a picture worth?
If we can't say a single word
We always put a filter on
To try to cover up the flaws
And if we do it all for show
I think it's time we let it go

[Hook]
Cause I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter
I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter on

[Verse 2]
Remember when we didn't have to live a lie
And now we can't even look each other in the eye
Yeah, I'd like to believe we could go back to the start
And if we turn it off would you see me in the dark?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you hold me
Just for a moment?

[Chorus]
And what we let the whole world see
Isn't really you and me
So tell me was a picture worth?
If we can't say a single word
We always put a filter on
To try to cover up the flaws
And of we do it all for show
I think it's time we let it go
Time we let it go

[Hook]
Cause I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter
I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter on

[Outro]
And we look so amazing, who wouldn't wanna be us?
But the smile that I'm faking
Fades when the camera's off
And we hold it
Just for the moment

[Chorus]
And what we let the whole world see
Isn't really you and me
So tell me was a picture worth?
If we can't say a single word
We always put a filter on
To try to cover up the flaws
And if we do it all for show
I think it's time we let it go

[Hook]
Cause I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter
I can picture us, picture us
I can picture us with no filter on
With no filter on
