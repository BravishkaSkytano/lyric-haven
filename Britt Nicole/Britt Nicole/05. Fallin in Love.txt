Over and over
Over and over

[Verse 1]
I been thinking 'bout ya
Every second, day and night
Yep, it's something I just can't ignore
My heart can't hide it
Even if I tried that's no denying
Yep, nothing on the world I want more

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got this feeling and I can't explain it
Can't explain it
You got me feeling something so amazing
So amazing
There's no denying that my heart is racing
This is crazy
I don't wanna run this time
I just wanna stay this time

[Chorus]
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)

[Verse 2]
I could stare into your eyes for a lifetime
Yep, the way that you're looking at me, 'cause
You stood beside me, even when the storm was terrifying
Yep, you showed me what love really means

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my hand and whenever you take it
You take it
I get the feeling like you're gonna make it
Gonna make it
There's no denying that my heart is racing
This is crazy
I don't wanna run this time
I just wanna stay this time

[Chorus]
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)
Cause I can't stop falling, won't stop falling
I can't stop falling (Over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)

[Bridge]
You say I'm beautiful, you do
You say I'm classic and cool
You say you like the way I dress
Like my hair a mess, baby
I can be myself with you
I think you're beautiful, I do
I think you're classic and smooth, yeah
Right now I confess
I won't make you guess, baby
I know I'm falling for you
Yeah! Hey! It feels so good
You feel that? Hey!
We're fallin' in love

[Chorus]
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)
Cause I can't stop falling, won't stop falling
I can't stop falling (fallin' in love)
I just wanna keep on fallin' in love with you
Ooh (Over and over)

[Outro]
You are my love
You are my everything
You are my baby
This love is crazy
You're the one I love
I think you're beautiful, I do
I keep on falling
I keep on falling
