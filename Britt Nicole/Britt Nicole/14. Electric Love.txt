Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here just waiting for my cell phone to ring
'Cause I can't get you off my mind
My heart is racing faster than electricity
'Cause I keep thinkin' about that night

[Pre-Chorus]
And then when you held my hand, asked me to dance
We danced under the lights
Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance?
And boy, you got it right

[Chorus]
Cause we got that electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know that it's true with you
Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know it's true
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel cause I know that it's true with you
Electric love

[Verse 2]
Now we got this power that's between you and me
Like lightning will light up the sky (Light up the sky)
If we got each other then we got what we need
Forever will be burnin' bright

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when you held my hand, asked me to dance
We danced under the lights
Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance?
And boy, you got it right

[Chorus]
'Cause we got that electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know that it's true  with you
Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know it's true
I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know that it's true with you
Electric love

[Bridge]
So tell me where you wanna, tell me where you wanna go
We can fly to the moon and watch the world down below
We can sail into the open, we can sail into the open seas
Boy, if I got you, thnn I got all I need
Yeah, 'cause we got electric, we got electric love
Baby, we got electric, we got electric love, oh

[Hook]
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric, it's electric
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love
Electric love

[Chorus]
Electric love (I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know that it's true with you)
Electric love (Oh, I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know it's true)
Electric love (I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'cause I know that it's true with you)

[Outro]
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance, and boy, did we get it right
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance, and boy, did we get it right
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance, and boy, did we get it right
Remember we were dancin' all through the night
We took a chance, and boy, did we get it right
