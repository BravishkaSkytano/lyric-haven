
You were walking on the moon
Now you're feeling low
What they said wasn't true
You're beautiful
Sticks n' stones break your bones
I know what you're feeling
Words like those won't steal your glow
You're one in a million

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold your head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

Gold
You're gold
You're worth more than gold
Gold
You're gold

When everybody keeps score
Afraid you're gonna lose
Just ignore
They don't know the real you
All the rain in the sky
Can't put out your fire
Of all the stars out tonight
You shine brighter

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold your head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

Gold
You're gold
You're worth more than gold
Gold
You're gold

So don't let anybody tell you that you're not loved
And don't let anybody tell you that you're not enough
Yeah, there are days when we all feel like we're messed up
But the truth is that we're all diamonds in the rough
So don't be ashamed to wear you're crown
You're a king, you're a queen inside and out
You glow like the moon, you shine like the stars
This is for you, wherever you are

You're gold

This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you been told
You're worth more than gold
So hold your head up high
It's your time to shine
From the inside out it shows
You're worth more than gold

Gold
You're gold
You're worth more than gold
Gold
You're gold

So don't be ashamed to wear your crown
You're a king, you're a queen, inside and out
