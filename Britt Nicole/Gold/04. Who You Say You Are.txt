
You know my name
I know You wrote my story
But there are days
I can't see a happy ending
No, no
Life gets hard
Sometimes it just hurts
It's kicking me down and throwing me curves
When I feel the rain
I won't be afraid

'Cause I know, I know, I know You are who You say You are
Who You say You are
You are the one still standin' when everything is falling apart
Yeah, You got my heart
I'll still be smilin' when the sky is dark 
'Cause I believe that You are who You say You are 

I've had control
But I didn't know where I was going
I went down my road
But my road just left me broken, yeah
I see it all now
I don't know how
But there's never been a time that You let me down
Or walked away, so I'm not afraid

'Cause I know, I know, I know you are who You say You are
Who You say You are
You are the one still standing when everything is falling apart
Yeah, You got my heart
I'll still be smiling when the sky is dark 
'Cause I believe that You are who You say You are 

Life's gonna knock me down
It's not gonna keep me down
I'm gonna trust You now in every season
I know You're here
I know You're for me
I know that joy comes in the morning
God, I believe it now
God, I believe You now

You're who You say You are
When life knocks me down
I won't stay down
I'll get back up on my feet now
You're more than a conqueror

I know, I know, I know you are who You say You are
Who You say You are
You are the one still standing when everything is falling apart
Yeah, You got my heart
I'll still be smiling when the sky is dark 
'Cause I believe that You are who You say You are
