He knows my name
He knows my name
He knows my name
Yes, He knows my name
And oh, how  He walks with me
Yes, oh, how He talks with me
And oh, how He tells me
That I am His own

[Chorus 1: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
You know my name

And oh, how You counsel me
Yet it still amazes me
That I am Your friend

[Bridge 1: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
No fire can burn me
No battle can turn me
No mountain can stop me
'Cause You hold my hand
Now I'm walking in Your victory
'Cause Your power is within me
No giant can defeat me
'Cause You hold my hand
No fire can burn me
No battle can turn me
No mountain can stop me
'Cause You hold my hand
Now I'm walking in Your victory
'Cause Your power is within me
No giant can defeat me
'Cause You hold my hand
No fire can burn me
No battle can turn me
No mountain can stop me
'Cause You hold my hand
Now I'm walking in Your victory
'Cause Your power is within me
No giant can defeat me
'Cause You hold my hand...
