Play the lotto you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feelin' when you're just about to kill it
Take your last show you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air
Woah

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big I feel it happening oh
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big

It's like the feeling when you bout to win the medal
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singin'
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
Woah

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big I feel it happening oh
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big

Woah
Yeah yeah
If we stomp our feet the ground will shake
If we clap our hands the walls will break
Yell so loud won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this pack and start a fire
Raise yourself we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big is happening woah
Wah ah ah oh, wah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
Wah ah ah oh
Something big I feel it happening oh
