
Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
No, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
I mean where did I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you never know what you did to me
And now you were gone

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
I don't even know your name
I'm running, I'm searching

And I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love
You punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
Till I hold you in my arms
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love
You punched a hole right through my heart
I won't stop, stop looking
Till I hold you in my arms
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile l on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name
And I don't even know your name
