
Remember that one Friday night never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies I'll be fine I know where I'm headed
Probably should've known

Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me
Told you once told you twice your gonna regret it
Now you're all alone yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me 
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Close your eyes you get high
Try to forget me but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you regretted
When you left me there

Now you're gonna say pretty please forgive me yeah
But it hurts it gets worse you know nobody said it would be fair
Oh yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day but you can't

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me 
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Truth is that no one can replace me 
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
