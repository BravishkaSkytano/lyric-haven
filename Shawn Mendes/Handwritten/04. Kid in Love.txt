
I know that we just met
Maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something
From the moment that we touched
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

The way you're lightin' up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I don't ever wanna grow up

Said, your place is kinda cozy
Your parents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
Just start tonight

If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be fine if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
And I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
All, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
And I don't ever wanna grow up

You make me feel like I got it all, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like I got it all, yeah
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel like I don't ever wanna grow up

Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then we don't ever have to grow up
Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh baby
When we're alone and it's the two of us
I can't get enough

I've got it all, yeah
I've got it all, yeah
And I've got it, and I've got it all
I've got it all, and we've got it all
And I've got it all, and I've got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
